# PHP-and-SQL-project
Website made using PHP that loads data from SQL database. SQL data can be added, changed or deleted. Both username and password is "admin".

Project needs to be downloaded and moved to folder "htdocs" in XAMPP folder. XAMPP modules Apache and MySQL need to be running.
SQL database needs to be imported in phpMyAdmin. To do that go to "http://localhost/phpmyadmin" and create new database named "pwaprojekt". After you created it click
import at the top and import "pwaprojekt.sql" file that you downloaded from here.
After that project can be opened in browser with URL: http://localhost/pwaprojekt/index.php
